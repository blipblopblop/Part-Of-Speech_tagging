# Part-Of-Speech_tagging
Predicting POS tags for untagged text by performing inference with the HMM model. Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging is a subset task within Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each word texts are associated with a POS tags where the total number of tags depends organization of tagged texts.

My project's main task is to create a hidden Markov model (HMM) that can figure out a sequence of underlying states given a sequence of observations. This is done using initial, transition and observation probability tables for the HMM model.
